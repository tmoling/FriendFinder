### How it works:
1. Enter your name and an online link to an image of yourself.
2. Answer 10 questions about yourself using a scale of one (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).

3. The name and image of your best match will display in a Bootstrap Modal.
4. Enjoy, have fun and never be alone again!
